Installation for Windows 64 Bit PCs
Prerequisites

Before installing the robot program, we have to download the compiler and libraries

Compiler
1. First download the compiler - https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/7.3.0/threads-posix/seh/x86_64-7.3.0-release-posix-seh-rt_v5-rev0.7z/download
2. Once its finished downloading, unzip the file, and open the mingw64 folder
3. Copy the  contents of the  mingw64 folder into a folder called  MinGW in your main drive (typically C:)
   Your folder should look like this (Look at "MinGW folder.PNG")

4. Enter the  bin folder and  copy its  directory (e.g. C:\MinGW\bin)
   The  directory of the  folder can be accessed by  clicking on the  address bar containing the text  (...> MinGW)
5. Next go to your  environment variables 

* In  Windows 8 and 10, this can be done by going into  search and  looking up "Environment Variables"
* In  Windows 7, this can be done by going into  Control panel > System and Security > System > Advanced Settings > Environment Variables

6.  Edit your Path Variables so that it contains the directory of the compiler bin folder
    This can be done by scrolling down and clicking the Variable labelled Path, in the bottom right corner there should be a button called
    Edit. Click on it and a window will pop up. Click New on the right hand side, and paste in your directory. Do it for both user and system
    variables 




  
 SFML Libraries 
1. First  download the SFML Library - https://www.sfml-dev.org/files/SFML-2.5.1-windows-gcc-7.3.0-mingw-64-bit.zip
2. Once its finished downloading,  unzip the file, and open the  SFML-2.5.1 Folder
3. Copy the contents of the  SFML-2.5.1 folder into a folder called  SFML in your main drive (typically C:)
   Your folder should look like this (Look at "SFML folder.png")





Installing Robot Files
1. First download the AVC_WIN10 zip file, or unzip from the zipped repo file
2. Once its finished downloading,  unzip the file, and open the  AVC_WIN10 Folder
3. Go into your  SFML folder and enter the  bin folder
4. Copy all of the  contents inside the folder and  paste them into the  AVC_robot folder and the  AVC_server folder
   (Look at "SFMLBin.png)

5.  Delete the  robot.exe, robot.o, server3.exe, and server.o files from their folders
6.  Go into Geany, click  build in the uppermost toolbar, click on  Set Build Commands
7. Change the  make command to mingw32-make
Your build commands should look like this (Look at "Build Commands.png")

8.  Download the  robot.cpp file from the repository and put it into the  AVC_robot folder

IMPORTANT 
If your  SFML folder directory does not look like this (C:\SFML) because you put it in the wrong place during installation, either go back to
SFML libraries and follow the instructions or go into the  makefiles of both the robot and the  server folders, and change the code at the top
line to whatever directory your folder has, INCLUDE an extra \ after C:\

The  directory of the  folder can be accessed by  clicking on the  address bar containing the text  (.../>SFML)

9. Open the  robot.cpp file, and the  server3.cpp file, for  each file, go into  build, and click  make






Running Program
* To choose the maze to run, enter config.txt, there are three mazes to choose from (core.txt, completion.txt, challenge.txt) remove the core.txt
  and replace it with any of the given mazes

* To run the maze program, execute the server3.exe file in AVC_server folder

* To run the robot program, execute the robot.exe file in AVC_robot folder
